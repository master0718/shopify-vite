The `vite-plugin-shopify-theme-settings` plugin provides developers with the ability to split their `settings_schema.json` sections into separate source files to make it easier to manage. It also includes functionality to automatically populate the `theme_settings` section of the schema file with details from your project's `package.json` file (such as the current version). More details can be found in the plugin README [here](https://github.com/barrel/barrel-shopify/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-shopify-modules/README.md).
