The `vite-plugin-shopify-modules` plugin allows developers to use a “modules” folder within their Shopify theme to co-locate Liquid, CSS, and JS files related to a specific theme module in the same folder while retaining full compatibility with the Shopify CLI. This approach requires developers to follow an opinionated file structure and may not be suitable for all projects.
