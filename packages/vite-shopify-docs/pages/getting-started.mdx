# Getting Started

## Installation

First, install `vite` and `vite-plugin-shopify` using your Node package manager of choice and include it with your project's devDependencies:

```js
// NPM
npm i -D vite vite-plugin-shopify

// PNPM
pnpm add -D vite vite-plugin-shopify

// Yarn
yarn add -D vite vite-plugin-shopify
```

Next, create a `vite.config.js` file in your project root directory and add the Shopify plugin:

```js
import vitePluginShopify from 'vite-plugin-shopify'

export default {
  plugins: [
    // Plugin options are not required (defaults shown)
    vitePluginShopify({
      // Path to Shopify theme directory (location of snippets, sections, templates, etc.)
      themeRoot: './',
      // Path to front-end source code path
      sourceCodeDir: 'frontend',
      // Path to front-end entry points path
      entrypointsDir: 'frontend/entrypoints',
      // Additional files to use as entry points (accepts an array of file paths or glob patterns)
      additionalEntrypoints: []
    })
  ]
}
```

Create an entry point file in one of Vite's supported file formats and place it in your entrypointsDir directory. Finally, insert the script or stylesheet into the desired location of your theme by passing in a relative path from the entrypoints directory to the `vite-tag` liquid snippet. For example, given an entry point file located at `frontend/entrypoints/theme.ts`:

```liquid
{% render 'vite-tag' with 'theme.ts' %}
```

To enable support for Vite's HMR functionality, render the vite-client snippet somewhere in your theme code:

```liquid
{% render 'vite-client' %}
```

(Note: The `vite-tag` and `vite-client` liquid snippets will be auto-generated and inserted into your theme's snippets folder each time you run the Vite development server or initiate a production build.)

## Development & Deployment

To start development, run the `vite` CLI command. In development, the `vite-tag` snippet will output a module script tag or stylesheet link tag which loads the desired entry point file from the Vite development server. In production, the snippet will output a tag to load the compiled asset from Shopify's CDN, along with additional script and link tags for any imported modules.

```liquid
<!-- HTML output from vite-tag snippet (development) -->
<script src="http://localhost:5173/theme.ts" type="module"></script>

<!-- HTML output from vite-tag snippet (production) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'theme.4d95c99b.css' | asset_url }}">
<script src="{{ 'theme.3b623fca.js' | asset_url }}" type="module" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<link href="{{ 'lodash.13b0d649.js' | asset_url }}" rel="modulepreload" as="script" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

We recommend adding [script commands](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts) to your project's `package.json` file to integrate the Vite server with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli).

The following example provides a `start` command to run the Vite and Shopify servers in parallel, and a `deploy` command to compile assets for production and push the theme code to your Shopify store.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "run-p vite:serve shopify:serve",
  "deploy": "run-s vite:build shopify:push",
  "vite:serve": "vite",
  "vite:build": "vite build",
  "shopify:serve": "shopify theme serve",
  "shopify:push": "shopify theme push"
}
```

(Note: The above example depends on the [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) package being installed to your project.)
